\section{Introduction}

Einstein's theory of General Relativity has been the dominant theory of gravity for a century. Many of its signature outcomes, such as light-bending, orbit precession, and gravitational waves, have been confirmed by precision tests from both astronomy and cosmology. One last pending test is the gravitational rotation of polarizations. Indeed, since gravity directly affects the spacetime geometry, not only the paths of light can be bent; the polarization, intuitively an ``internal'' degree of freedom of the light ray, cannot escape the influence of gravity either.

Such gravitational rotation of polarization has not been measured so far\footnote{The E-mode and B-mode in CMB are defined as the relative angle between polarization and gradient. The observed rotation is a consequence of a rotated gradient but a fixed polarization, thus it does not count.}.  One obvious reason is that it is usually very small. The rotation angle of a linearly polarized light ray, caused by a gravitational lens, is suppressed by two small numbers.
\begin{equation}
\Delta\phi \propto \frac{2GM}{r} \cdot v~.
\label{eq-v}
\end{equation}
Here $M$ is the mass of the lens, $r$ is the impact parameter---the shortest distance when the light ray pass near the lens, and $v$ is the velocity of the lens.  Unless the light goes through somewhere comparable to the Schwarzschild radius, the first factor is small. Unless the velocity is almost relativistic, the second factor is small. 

Luckily, an almost edge-on, compact pulsar binary system, such as the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039, can be a vern strong candidate to measure such effect. Pulsar signals are often highly polarized, allowing precise measurements of its rotation; an almost edge-on orbit allows the impact parameter to be very small at the superior conjunction; and its compact orbit means a large velocity. One main point of this paper is to show that one can expect to have $\Delta\phi\sim 10^{-7}$ from double pulsar, which has a good chance to be observable given a realistic observation campaign.

Gravitational rotation of polarization from double pulsar was previously studied in \cite{RugTar06}. They however derived a much smaller number which is incorrect. Such mistake is not difficult to understand. Although Eq.~(\ref{eq-v}) has been derived by some authors, such as in \cite{KopMas01}, a significant collection of literature is still filled with confusions. For example, {\bf cite XXX} summarized how three different values of $\Delta\phi$ can be derived from the same physical sitution, but it provided no explicit judgement, nor convincing reason, of which one is actually correct.

In this paper, we will resolve such confusion by starting from the operational definition of how to actually measure such rotation. Naturally, that led us to a gauge-invariant quantity. It turns out that there is a gauge-invariant $SO(3,1)$ gravitational rotation of the tangent space along any light ray, however the rotation of polarization is an $SO(2)$ projection of that. The null vector of the light ray and the timelike vector of the observer together determines which $SO(2)$ to project to, {\it thus the actual rotation of polarization depends on the relative velocity between the lens and the observer,} which is exactly the $v$ dependence in Eq.~(\ref{eq-v}).

In Sec.\ref{sec-born}, we will derive Eq.~(\ref{eq-v}) in the Born approximation and the geometric limit. In Sec.\ref{sec-prediction}, we will describe the observable effects on double pulsar and discuss the appropriate observation campaign to detect it.
